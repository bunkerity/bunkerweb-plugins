## Executive Summary

The malware-scan plugin processes personal data (IP addresses) as part of its security functionality. This document outlines the GDPR compliance measures implemented in the plugin and the responsibilities of administrators who deploy it.

### Key Points

- **Legal Basis**: Legitimate Interest (Article 6(1)(f)) - Security monitoring and infrastructure protection
- **Data Controller**: The administrator deploying BunkerWeb, not the plugin itself
- **Personal Data**: Client IP addresses, upload timestamps, file hashes
- **Retention**: 90 days (cache), up to 90 days (logs)
- **Data Minimization**: IP anonymization in webhooks (default: enabled)
- **Rights**: Access and erasure requests handled by administrators

### Compliance Status

✅ **Implemented**:
- IP anonymization in webhooks (Article 5(1)(c) - Data Minimization)
- Configurable retention periods (Article 5(1)(e) - Storage Limitation)
- Legitimate interest legal basis (Article 6(1)(f))
- Security measures for data protection (Article 32)

⚠️ **Administrator Action Required**:
- Privacy policy documentation (Article 13-14 - Transparency)
- Data subject rights implementation (Articles 15-17)
- Log retention policy enforcement (Article 5(1)(e))

---

## Data Processing Overview

### What is Personal Data?

Under GDPR Article 4(1), **personal data** means:
> "any information relating to an identified or identifiable natural person"

**IP addresses are personal data** per CJEU Case C-582/14 (Breyer v Germany).

### Purpose of Data Processing

The plugin processes personal data for:
1. **Malware detection** - Scanning uploaded files for threats
2. **Security monitoring** - Tracking repeat malware upload attempts
3. **Incident response** - Alerting administrators of attacks
4. **Infrastructure protection** - Blocking malicious uploads

---

## Legal Basis

### Article 6(1)(f) - Legitimate Interest

The plugin relies on **legitimate interest** as the legal basis for processing IP addresses:

**Purpose**: Security monitoring - tracking attackers and distributed malware to fulfill security expectations

**Necessity**: Full IP addresses (not anonymized) are needed for:
- Forensic evidence of malicious intent
- Proving attacks in legal proceedings (Article 17(3)(e) exception)
- Protecting servers, data, and users from malware

**Balancing Test**:
- **Controller's Interest**: Protecting infrastructure from malware attacks (high priority)
- **Data Subject's Interest**: Privacy expectations when uploading malware (low expectation of privacy for malicious activity)
- **Result**: Security interest outweighs attacker's privacy expectations

### Why Not Consent?

Consent (Article 6(1)(a)) is **not appropriate** for security monitoring because:
- Attackers would not provide consent
- Security measures must be effective regardless of consent
- Consent can be withdrawn, undermining security
- Legitimate interest is the proper legal basis for security purposes

---

## Data Collected

### 1. Attacker Tracking Data

**Enabled when**: `MALWARE_SCAN_TRACK_ATTACKERS=yes` (default)

| Data Element | Example | Purpose | Retention |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| IP Address | `192.168.1.123` | Identify repeat offenders | 90 days (configurable) |
| First Upload | `2026-01-19 10:30:00 UTC` | Track attack timeline | 90 days (configurable) |
| Last Upload | `2026-01-19 14:22:15 UTC` | Track attack timeline | 90 days (configurable) |
| Upload Count | `5` | Identify repeat offenders | 90 days (configurable) |
| Checksums | `["abc123...", "def456..."]` | Link malware samples | 90 days (configurable) |

**Storage Location**: Redis cache
**Cache Key Format**: `plugin_malware_scan_attacker_[ipv4|ipv6]_[IP_ADDRESS]`
**TTL**: Configurable via `MALWARE_SCAN_TRACK_ATTACKER_TTL` (default: 7776000 seconds / 90 days)
**TTL Behavior**: TTL resets on each new malware upload from the same IP. The 90-day window is always from the LAST upload, not the first.
**Rationale**: Extended 90-day retention allows sufficient time to gather evidence for law enforcement and legal proceedings

### 2. Scan Results Cache

**Purpose**: Performance optimization - avoid re-scanning known files

| Data Element | Example | Purpose | Retention |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| File Hash (SHA256) | `abc123def456...` | Identify file | 5 min (clean) / 90 days (malicious) |
| Detection Results | `Win.Trojan.Zusy-9935890-0` | Cache scanner responses | 5 min (clean) / 90 days (malicious) |
| Scanner Names | `ClamAV, VirusTotal` | Cache scanner responses | 5 min (clean) / 90 days (malicious) |

**Storage Location**: Redis cache
**Cache Key Format**: `plugin_malware_scan_result_[SHA256]`
**TTL**: 300 seconds (clean files), 7776000 seconds (malicious files)
**Rationale**: Long retention for malicious hashes reduces API calls, improves performance for repeat attacks, and maintains detection history

**Note**: File hashes alone are **not personal data**, but combined with IP address tracking may constitute personal data through linkability.

### 3. Application Logs

**Purpose**: Security monitoring, debugging, incident investigation

| Data Element | Example | Storage | Retention |
|--------------|---------|---------|-----------|
| IP Addresses | `192.168.1.123` | BunkerWeb logs | Administrator controlled (recommend ≤90 days) |
| Timestamps | `2026-01-19 10:30:00` | BunkerWeb logs | Administrator controlled (recommend ≤90 days) |
| Detection Results | `ClamAV: Win.Trojan.Zusy` | BunkerWeb logs | Administrator controlled (recommend ≤90 days) |
| File Checksums | `abc123def456...` | BunkerWeb logs | Administrator controlled (recommend ≤90 days) |
| Server Names | `www.example.com` | BunkerWeb logs | Administrator controlled (recommend ≤90 days) |
| Request URIs | `/upload.php` | BunkerWeb logs | Administrator controlled (recommend ≤90 days) |

**Storage Location**: `/var/log/bunkerweb/` (default) or custom log path
**Retention**: Not automatically managed - administrator responsibility
**Recommendation**: Implement log rotation with maximum 90-day retention

### 4. Webhook Notifications (Optional)

**Enabled when**: `MALWARE_SCAN_TEAMS_WEBHOOK_URL` or `MALWARE_SCAN_DISCORD_WEBHOOK_URL` configured

**Data Minimization**: IP addresses in webhooks are **anonymized by default** (GDPR Article 5(1)(c))

| Data Element | Original | Anonymized (default) | Purpose |
|--------------|----------|----------------------|---------|
| IPv4 Address | `192.168.1.123` | `192.168.1.x` | Alert security team |
| IPv6 Address | `2001:db8::1234:5678` | `2001:db8::1234:x` | Alert security team |
| Server Name | `www.example.com` | `www.example.com` | Identify affected service |
| Detection Results | `ClamAV: Win.Trojan` | `ClamAV: Win.Trojan` | Understand threat |
| File Checksum | `abc123def456...` | `abc123def456...` | Identify malware sample |

**Configuration**: `MALWARE_SCAN_ANONYMIZE_WEBHOOK_IPS=yes` (default: yes)
**Third Parties**: Microsoft Teams, Discord (US companies - international data transfer)
**Retention by Third Parties**: Potentially indefinite (no control)

---

## GDPR Compliance Measures

### 1. Data Minimization (Article 5(1)(c))

**Issue**: Sharing full IP addresses with third parties (Microsoft Teams/Discord) excessive for security alerting.

**Solution**: Implemented IP anonymization in webhooks (v0.7.2)
- IPv4: `192.168.1.123` → `192.168.1.x`
- IPv6: `2001:db8:1234:5678:90ab:cdef:1234:5678` → `2001:db8:1234:5678:90ab:cdef:1234:x`
- Enabled by default: `MALWARE_SCAN_ANONYMIZE_WEBHOOK_IPS=yes`
- Network-level information sufficient for security teams

**Code**: [malware_scan_webhook.lua:133-161](malware_scan_webhook.lua#L133-L161)

### 2. Storage Limitation (Article 5(1)(e))

**Requirement**: Personal data must be kept only as long as necessary for the purpose.

**Implementation**:
- Attacker tracking: 90 days default (configurable: `MALWARE_SCAN_TRACK_ATTACKER_TTL`)
- Scan results: 5 minutes (clean) / 90 days (malicious)
- Logs: Administrator controlled (recommend maximum 90 days)

**Rationale**:
- 90 days provides adequate time for law enforcement and legal proceedings
- Allows gathering comprehensive evidence of attack patterns
- Malicious file hashes rarely change, making long-term caching beneficial
- Balances security needs with privacy rights

### 3. Security of Processing (Article 32)

**Measures Implemented**:
- ✅ Input validation (prevents command injection, path traversal)
- ✅ Data sanitization (prevents log injection)
- ✅ Access control (restrictive permissions)
- ✅ Encryption in transit (HTTPS webhooks)
- ✅ Pseudonymization (IP anonymization in webhooks)
- ✅ DoS protection (file size limits)

### 4. Transparency (Articles 13-14)

**Requirement**: Data subjects must be informed about data processing.

**Administrator Action Required**: Add privacy policy notice (see [Recommended Privacy Policy](#recommended-privacy-policy))

**Minimum Information to Provide**:
- Identity and contact details of data controller
- Purpose of processing (malware detection and security)
- Legal basis (legitimate interest)
- Legitimate interests pursued (infrastructure protection)
- Retention period (90 days cache, 90 days logs)
- Data subject rights (access, erasure, object)
- Right to lodge complaint with supervisory authority

---

## Administrator Responsibilities

### You Are the Data Controller

As a BunkerWeb administrator deploying the malware-scan plugin, **you** are the **data controller** under GDPR Article 4(7):

> "the natural or legal person [...] which, alone or jointly with others, determines the purposes and means of the processing of personal data"

The plugin is a tool/processor - you determine how it's used and are responsible for GDPR compliance.

### Your Obligations

#### 1. Privacy Policy (Articles 13-14)

**Required**: Yes
**Deadline**: Before collecting personal data
**Action**: Add malware scanning section to your website's privacy policy (see template below)

#### 2. Log Retention Policy (Article 5(1)(e))

**Required**: Yes
**Recommendation**: Maximum 90 days for malware-related logs
**Action**: Configure log rotation

```bash
# Example: logrotate configuration
/var/log/bunkerweb/*.log {
    daily
    rotate 90
    compress
    delaycompress
    missingok
    notifempty
    create 0640 nginx adm
}
```

#### 3. Data Subject Rights (Articles 15-17, 20)

**Required**: Yes
**Action**: Implement process for handling access and erasure requests (see [Data Subject Rights](#data-subject-rights))

#### 4. Records of Processing Activities (Article 30)

**Required**: If your organization has 250+ employees OR processes special categories of personal data OR processing poses high risk
**Recommendation**: Document processing activities even if not required

---

## Handling Data Subject Access Requests (Article 15)

### Request Format

Data subjects must prove their identity. Common approaches:
- Request from the same IP address tracked
- Email with verification
- Formal written request with ID proof

### Steps to Process Access Request

#### 1. Verify Identity
Ensure requester is the data subject or authorized representative.

#### 2. Query Redis Cache

Check attacker tracking data:

```bash
# For IPv4
redis-cli GET "plugin_malware_scan_attacker_ipv4_192.168.1.123"

# For IPv6
redis-cli GET "plugin_malware_scan_attacker_ipv6_2001:db8:1234:5678:90ab:cdef:1234:5678"
```

**Output Example**:
```json
{
  "upload_count": 3,
  "first_upload": 1737277800,
  "last_upload": 1737291720,
  "checksums": ["abc123def456...", "789xyz012..."]
}
```

#### 3. Search Application Logs

Search for all log entries containing the IP address:

```bash
# Search logs
grep "192.168.1.123" /var/log/bunkerweb/*.log

# Search with date filter
find /var/log/bunkerweb/ -name "*.log" -mtime -90 -exec grep "192.168.1.123" {} +
```

#### 4. Prepare Response

Compile information into structured format:

```json
{
  "data_subject_ip": "192.168.1.123",
  "data_controller": "Your Organization Name",
  "request_date": "2026-01-19",
  "data_collected": {
    "attacker_tracking": {
      "upload_count": 3,
      "first_upload": "2026-01-19 10:30:00 UTC",
      "last_upload": "2026-01-19 14:22:15 UTC",
      "malware_hashes": ["abc123...", "789xyz..."]
    },
    "log_entries": [
      {
        "timestamp": "2026-01-19 10:30:00",
        "server": "www.example.com",
        "detection": "ClamAV: Win.Trojan.Zusy-9935890-0",
        "hash": "abc123def456..."
      }
    ]
  },
  "processing_details": {
    "purpose": "Malware detection and infrastructure protection",
    "legal_basis": "Legitimate interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f))",
    "retention_period": "90 days (cache), up to 90 days (logs)",
    "recipients": "Microsoft Teams / Discord (if webhooks enabled, anonymized)",
    "rights": "Access, erasure (with exceptions), restriction, object"
  }
}
```

#### 5. Deliver Response

- **Deadline**: Within 1 month (Article 12(3))
- **Format**: Free of charge, electronic format preferred
- **Language**: Same language as request

---

## Handling Erasure Requests (Article 17)

### Evaluation Process

#### Step 1: Assess Legal Grounds for Refusal

You may refuse erasure if data is needed for **legal claims** (Article 17(3)(e)):

**Refuse if**:
- Evidence of ongoing attack
- Potential legal proceedings anticipated
- Required for law enforcement cooperation
- Needed to defend against lawsuits

**Grant if**:
- Single, isolated detection months ago
- No ongoing security concern
- No legal proceedings anticipated

#### Step 2: If Granting Erasure

**Automatic Data Expiry**:

The plugin uses TTL (Time To Live) for automatic data expiry:
- **Attacker tracking cache**: Expires automatically after 90 days (default, configurable via `MALWARE_SCAN_TRACK_ATTACKER_TTL`)
  - **Important**: TTL resets on each new malware upload from the same IP. For continuous attackers, the 90-day window is from the LAST upload.
- **Scan result cache**: Expires automatically after 5 minutes (clean files) or 90 days (malicious files)

**No manual deletion required** - the cache system handles expiry automatically.

**Action Required**: Log the erasure request for audit trail

```bash
# Log the erasure request (IMPORTANT: for audit trail)
echo "[$(date)] GDPR_ERASURE: Request from 192.168.1.123 - Status: GRANTED - Data expires via TTL (90 days)" >> /var/log/gdpr_requests.log
```

**Important Notes**:
- Data will be automatically deleted when TTL expires (maximum 90 days)
- Do NOT delete from application logs if needed for audit/legal purposes
- Keep erasure request log for accountability (Article 5(2))
- Inform data subject that cache data expires within 90 days automatically

#### Step 3: If Refusing Erasure

Document the refusal:

```bash
# Log the erasure request and reason for refusal
echo "[$(date)] GDPR_ERASURE: Request from 192.168.1.123 - Status: REFUSED - Reason: Evidence needed for legal claims (Art 17(3)(e))" >> /var/log/gdpr_requests.log
```

#### Step 4: Respond to Data Subject

**If granted**:
```
Your erasure request has been granted as of [DATE].

Data Retention Details:
- Cached data (Redis): Will expire automatically within 90 days via TTL (Time To Live)
- Application logs: May be retained for audit purposes per Article 17(3)(e)
- Backups: May contain data until backup rotation completes
- Erasure request: Logged for accountability per Article 5(2)

Your cached data will be automatically removed from our systems when the retention period
expires (maximum 90 days from last upload attempt).

Important: If you continue uploading malware, the 90-day window resets with each new upload,
extending the retention period. This extended period allows us to maintain evidence for
potential law enforcement cooperation and legal proceedings.
```

**If refused**:
```
Your erasure request has been evaluated and refused pursuant to GDPR Article 17(3)(e).

Reason: The data is necessary for the establishment, exercise, or defence of legal claims.
Specifically, the malware upload attempts from your IP address constitute evidence that may be
required in potential legal proceedings.

Your rights:
- You may object to processing under Article 21
- You may lodge a complaint with the supervisory authority: [Your DPA contact info]
- You may re-submit this request when legal proceedings are no longer anticipated
```

## Malware Scanning and File Upload Security

### Overview

We use automated malware scanning to protect our infrastructure, services, and users from malicious uploads. This processing involves collecting and analyzing certain personal data as described below.

### What Data We Collect

When you upload files to our services, we collect and process:

- **IP address**: Your network address
- **Timestamp**: Date and time of upload attempt
- **File hash**: Cryptographic fingerprint (SHA256) of uploaded files
- **Detection results**: Malware scanner findings (if malicious content detected)
- **Upload history**: Number of malware upload attempts (if multiple detections)

### Why We Collect This Data

**Legal Basis**: Legitimate interest (GDPR Article 6(1)(f))

We have a legitimate interest in protecting our infrastructure and users from malware attacks. This interest includes:
- Detecting and blocking malware uploads
- Identifying repeat attackers
- Investigating security incidents
- Maintaining evidence for potential legal proceedings
- Alerting our security team to threats

**Balancing Test**: Our security interest in protecting infrastructure outweighs the privacy expectations of individuals attempting to upload malware.

### How Long We Keep Your Data

| Data Type | Retention Period | Reason |
|-----------|------------------|--------|
| Attacker tracking (cache) | 90 days | Evidence for law enforcement and legal proceedings |
| Scan results (cache) | 5 minutes to 90 days | Performance optimization and detection history |
| Application logs | Up to 90 days | Security monitoring and incident investigation |
| Audit logs | [Your retention period] | Legal compliance and accountability |

**Important**: The 90-day retention period for attacker tracking resets with each new malware upload from the same IP address. For continuous attackers, the retention window is always from the last upload attempt.

Data is automatically deleted when retention periods expire.

### Who We Share Your Data With

If malware is detected, we may send alerts to:
- **Microsoft Teams** (Microsoft Corporation, USA) - Security team notifications
- **Discord** (Discord Inc., USA) - Security team notifications

**Data Minimization**: IP addresses shared with third parties are anonymized (e.g., `192.168.1.123` becomes `192.168.1.x`) to minimize data exposure while maintaining network-level visibility for security purposes.

**International Transfer**: Microsoft and Discord are US-based companies. The EU does not consider the USA to have adequate data protection. We rely on legitimate interest for security purposes and apply data minimization measures (IP anonymization) to reduce risk.

### Your Rights

Under GDPR, you have the following rights:

#### Right to Access (Article 15)
You may request a copy of the data we hold about you by contacting: [Your contact email]

#### Right to Erasure (Article 17)
You may request deletion of your data by contacting: [Your contact email]

**Important**: We may refuse erasure requests if the data is necessary for establishing, exercising, or defending legal claims (e.g., evidence of malware attacks). This is permitted under Article 17(3)(e).

#### Right to Object (Article 21)
You may object to processing based on legitimate interest. We will cease processing unless we demonstrate compelling legitimate grounds that override your interests.

#### Right to Lodge a Complaint
If you believe we have violated GDPR, you may lodge a complaint with your national data protection authority:
- **EU Data Protection Authorities**: https://edpb.europa.eu/about-edpb/board/members_en
- **Your Local DPA**: [Insert local DPA contact information]

### Data Controller

The data controller responsible for this processing is:

**[Your Organization Name]**
[Your Address]
[Your Email]
[Your Phone]

### Data Protection Officer (if applicable)

If you have questions about data protection, you may contact our Data Protection Officer:

**[DPO Name]** (if required)
[DPO Email]

### Changes to This Policy

This privacy notice was last updated on [DATE]. We may update it periodically to reflect changes in our processing activities or legal requirements.
